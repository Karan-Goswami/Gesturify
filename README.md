1. On the home screen i.e. the main camera window you'll see three virtual buttons.
2. Move your hand to one of these virtual buttons and click any of the feature you want to use.
3. For clicking purpose, move your index finger to the button and then move your middle finger near to your index finger.
4. This will open new camera window with that functionality that you've selected.

3. Virtual Volume Controller
